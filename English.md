## Subject-Verb Agreement

Subject-verb agreement means that the subject and the verb in a sentence must match in number—that is, both need to be singular or both need to be plural.

- **Singular subjects take singular verbs**: She runs every morning. The dog barks at night.
- **Plural subjects take plural verbs**: They run every morning. The dogs bark at night. The developers (S) are (V) updating (V) the database schema (O).
- **With compound subjects joined by ‘and’ → use a plural verb**: Tom and Jerry are funny. The developer and the tester (S) are (V) working on bug fixes (O). John and Alice (S) are (V) reviewing the code (O).
- **With subjects joined by ‘or’ or ‘nor’ → verb agrees with the nearest subject**: Neither the teacher nor the students are ready. Either the students or the teacher is coming. Either the server or the database (S) is (V) causing the delay (O). Neither the API nor the database (S) is (V) available (A).
- **Indefinite pronouns (each, everyone, someone, etc.) are singular**: Each of the boys is ready. Everyone (S) must (V) test the code (O). Each (S) developer (V) has (V) commit access (O).
- **Collective nouns (team, group, family) are usually singular in American English**: The team wins every match.

### Adding -s to Verbs (Present Simple, He/She/It)
When the subject is he, she, it, or a singular noun, you usually add -s to the verb.

- I play → He plays
- You run → She runs
- They read → John reads

### Adding -es to Verbs
If the verb ends in -ch, -sh, -ss, -x, -o, add -es.

- Watch → watches
- Go → goes
- Wash → washes
- Mix → mixes
- Kiss → kisses

### Changing -y to -ies
If the verb ends in a consonant + y, change -y to -ies for he/she/it.

- Cry → cries
- Fly → flies
- Try → tries

But if there's a vowel before y, just add -s:

- Play → plays
- Enjoy → enjoys

### For Plural Nouns (Adding -s / -es)

**Regular plural**:
- Book → books
- Pen → pens

**Ends in -ch, -sh, -s, -x, -z → Add -es**:
- Brush → brushes
- Box → boxes

**Ends in consonant + y → Change y to -ies**:
- Baby → babies
- Story → stories

**Ends in vowel + y → Just add -s**:
- Toy → toys
- Key → keys


## Tenses

### Simple Present Tense

Hum Simple Present Tense ka use tab karte hain jab koi kaam regularly hota hai, ya hamesha sach hota hai, ya kisi fixed schedule ke according hota hai. Jaise agar koi bole, “I go to school every day,” iska matlab hai ki yeh uski daily routine hai. Isi tarah, “She drinks tea in the morning” batata hai ki yeh uski aadat hai.

Yeh tense hum universal truths ya scientific facts ke liye bhi use karte hain. For example, “The sun rises in the east” — yeh ek aisi baat hai jo kabhi change nahi hoti. Ek aur example ho sakta hai, “Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.”

Jab hum schedule ya timetable ke baare mein baat karte hain, jaise train, bus, movie, ya class timings, tab bhi hum simple present use karte hain. Jaise, “The train leaves at 6 PM.” Yeh future ki baat hai, lekin kyunki yeh fix time hai, isliye hum present tense use karte hain. Ek aur example hai: “The movie starts at 9 o’clock.”

Simple present tense ko hum instructions ya directions dene ke liye bhi use karte hain. Agar aap kisi ko recipe samjha rahe ho, toh aap bol sakte ho: “Boil the water and add the rice.” Ya phir direction dete waqt aap keh sakte ho: “Turn left at the signal.”

Aur finally, hum simple present un verbs ke saath bhi use karte hain jo feelings, thoughts, ya states ko dikhate hain — jaise “like,” “know,” “believe,” etc. For example, “She likes chocolate,” ya “I know the answer,” ya “They believe in hard work.” Yeh sab general thoughts aur feelings dikhate hain jo aksar change nahi hote.

**Examples:**
- The system (S) runs (V) every day (Adv).
- I (S) write (V) scripts (O) to automate deployments (A).
- The backend (S) handles (V) user requests (O).
- The server (S) checks (V) the user input (O) automatically (Adv).
- "I work on optimizing queries every morning."

### Simple Past Tense

Simple Past Tense ka use tab hota hai jab hum kisi aise action ke baare mein baat karte hain jo already complete ho chuka ho, ya jo ek fixed time par past mein hua ho. Jaise agar koi bole, “I went to the market yesterday,” iska matlab hai ki woh action kal complete ho gaya. Isi tarah, “She watched a movie last night” batata hai ki woh action raat ko complete hua.

Simple past tense ko hum completed actions ke liye use karte hain. Jaise, “He played football yesterday,” jo batata hai ki woh football khel chuka hai aur ab woh complete action hai.

Is tense ka use hum un actions ke liye bhi karte hain jo ek specific time par past mein hue ho. For example, “They visited their grandparents last weekend,” ya “I saw that movie last year.” Yeh sab actions past mein fixed time par huye hain.

**Examples:**
- I (S) fixed (V) the server issue (O) yesterday (Adv).
- The system (S) crashed (V) last night (Adv).
- We (S) deployed (V) the patch (O) successfully (Adv).
- The project (S) was (V) completed (V) last week (Adv).
- "I fixed the login issue yesterday."

### Simple Future Tense

Simple Future Tense ka use hum un actions ke liye karte hain jo aage future mein hone wale hain. Jab hum koi aisi baat karte hain jo hum soch rahe hain, plan kar rahe hain, ya jo ek definite future time par hone wali hai, tab hum simple future tense ka use karte hain.

Hum will ya shall ka use karte hain future actions ko show karne ke liye. Will ka use sabhi subjects ke saath hota hai (I, you, he, she, we, they). Shall ka use formal English mein hota hai, lekin zyada tar will ka use hota hai.

**Examples:**
- We (S) will upgrade (V) the database (O) tomorrow (Adv).
- I (S) will deploy (V) the new code (O) soon (Adv).
- They (S) will handle (V) the issue (O) next week (Adv).
- "I will start working on the new API integration tomorrow."

---

### Present Continuous Tense

Hum Present Continuous Tense ka use tab karte hain jab hum un actions ke baare mein baat karte hain jo abhi ho rahe hain ya jo present time ke around ho rahe hain. For example, agar main boloon, “I am eating lunch right now,” iska matlab hai ki yeh action abhi ho raha hai. In Hinglish: Main abhi lunch kha raha hoon.

Hum present continuous tense ko un actions ke liye bhi use karte hain jo present time ke around ho rahe hote hain, chahe wo exact moment pe na ho. For example, “She is working from home this week,” ka matlab hai ki woh office nahi ja rahi hai, par is week woh ghar se kaam kar rahi hai. In Hinglish: Woh is hafte ghar se kaam kar rahi hai.

Kabhi kabhi hum present continuous tense ka use future plans ya arrangements ke liye bhi karte hain. Jaise, “We are meeting them tomorrow,” yeh ek plan hai jo humne kal ke liye banaya hai. In Hinglish: Hum kal unse mil rahe hain.

**Examples:**
- I (S) am reviewing (V) the code (O) right now (Adv).
- We (S) are working (V) on the new API (O) this week (Adv).
- The backend team (S) is troubleshooting (V) the server downtime (O).

### Past Continuous Tense

Hum Past Continuous Tense ka use tab karte hain jab hum kisi aise action ke baare mein baat karte hain jo ek specific time par past mein ho raha tha, ya jab do actions ek hi waqt par past mein ho rahe hote hain. Jaise jab main boloon, “I was reading a book yesterday evening,” iska matlab hai ki main kal shaam ko ek specific time par kitaab padh raha tha. In Hinglish: Main kal shaam ko ek kitaab padh raha tha.

Hum past continuous tense ka use do actions ke liye bhi karte hain jo ek hi time par past mein ho rahe hote hain. Jaise, “While I was cooking, she was cleaning the house.” Dono actions ek hi waqt par ho rahe hain. In Hinglish: Jab main khaana bana raha tha, woh ghar saaf kar rahi thi.

Kabhi kabhi hum past continuous tense ka use un actions ke liye karte hain jo interrupted ho gaye the. Jaise, “I was walking when it started raining.” Yeh batata hai ki main chal raha tha aur baarish shuru ho gayi. In Hinglish: Main chal raha tha jab baarish shuru hui.

**Examples:**
- I (S) was debugging (V) the system (O) all night (Adv).
- They (S) were optimizing (V) the database queries (O) last week (Adv).
- The server (S) was running (V) slowly (Adv) during the update (Adv).

Another example is, “She has visited Paris.” Iska matlab hai ki kisi time pe Paris visit kiya tha, aur yeh experience ab bhi relevant hai. In Hinglish: Usne Paris ka safar kiya hai.
