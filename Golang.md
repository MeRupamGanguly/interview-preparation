# Introduce Yourself:

I have Btech in IT, Started my Career at Sensibol as Golang Backend Developer. There my Primary role was Developing REST APIs and Microservices, Business logics, Bug Fixes etc. We use Golang Aws MySql Redis etc. After I joined Calsoft and worked with Extreme Network CLient where my primary role was Bug Fixes, Crate APIs, Write Unit and Functional Test cases, We use Same Golang RabbitMQ, SQL gRPC etc.

# Projects:
I worked on PDL: Music distribution and royalty management platform. Basically I was the main work force on the Project.

Also worked on Singshala: Which is similar to Learn to Sing app.

Worked on XCO which is data center automation project, where we manage Multiple Switches and their PORTs and binding them according Profiles Fabric and Tenants.  

# Microservice vs Monolith:
- **Microservices** are better for large projects where scaling and almost zero downtime are required. Bug fixing and maintaining the codebase are easier. A disadvantage of microservices can be inter-service network calls.
- **Monolith** is suitable for smaller projects but can become difficult to scale or maintain as the application grows.
